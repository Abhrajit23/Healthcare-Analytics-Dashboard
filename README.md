Analyze Financial Health: Summarize total revenue, costs, and net income.

Evaluate Provider Performance: Assess individual provider efficiency and patient satisfaction.

Identify Key Trends: Highlight financial and operational patterns over time.

Explore Deeper Insights: Understand patient demographics, common diagnoses, and procedures.

The solution leverages advanced DAX, robust data modeling, and interactive visuals to mimic real-world business intelligence scenarios.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Techniques
Power BI Desktop : Report creation, visual design, and data modeling.

Power Query (M) : Data cleaning, transformation (e.g., date format consistency, handling null values, converting cost fields to numeric).

DAX: Advanced KPIs, measures (e.g., Total Room Charges, Total Revenue, Net Revenue), time intelligence (YoY, YTD), and custom calculated columns (Duration of Stay (Days), Primary Department, Age Group).

Relationships: Establishing a robust star schema across 8 tables for seamless cross-filtering.

Slicers: Dynamic filtering by Date, City, Provider, Department, Diagnosis, Procedure, Race, Age Group.

Visualizations: Diverse chart types (Cards, Line, Bar, Donut, Scatter, Treemap) for effective data communication.

Data Quality: Implementing DAX logic to handle data quality issues like negative durations in stay.

# üéØ Business Impact
